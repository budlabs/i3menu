- window      
  The currently active window.

- titlebar    
  The titlebar of the currently active window.

- tab         
  The tab (or titlebar if it isn't tabbed) of the currently active window.

- A,B,C or D  
  The **i3fyra** container of the same name if it is visible. If target container isn't visible the menu will be displayed at the default location.

- AC , BD
  Menu will cover visible containers in the given family.

titlebar and tab LAYOUT will be displayed as a single line (*dmenu like*) menu, and the other LAYOUTS will be of vertical (*combobox*) layout with the prompt and entrybox above the list.  

The position of the menu can be further manipulated by using `--xpos`,`--ypos`,`--width`,`--height`,`--orientation`,`--include`.  

`$ echo "list" | i3menu --prompt "select: " --layout window --xpos -50 --ypos 30`  
The command above would create a menu with the same size and position as the current window, but place it 50px to the left of the window, and 30px below the *lower* of the window.
